Hello!
The server is running on http://3.134.103.40/
It might ask you to login, but the permissions are off, so you can ignore
It does not work with big pictures, I haven't fixed that yet. 
Missing validition checks. like if the date recieved is not in the future or if recoving date is before getting sick date etc. just didn't have enough time! the data in quite corrupted
Also, the calls don't always return and display if the act was succesfully operated or failed


to-do:
//add primary key to vax and tests  so you adit/delete them as indepentence to profile! 
//query for positve negative without read

 all the data!
