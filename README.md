Hello!
The server is running on http://3.134.103.40/
It might ask you to login, but the permissions are off, so you can ignore
What the project is missing (just run out of time!) :
It does not work with big pictures, I haven't fixed that yet. 
Missing validition checks. like if the date recieved is not in the future or if recoving date is before getting sick date etc. 
Also, the calls don't always return and never display if the act was succesfully operated or failed

for installing and running thr project - it's somewhat hard coded here.
1: please change baseurl on dataFeed and welcome and config files to your updated IP/doamin. 
2: npm install
3: set postgress on your machine, if you set it somewhere else, you'll have to update the connection settings (in config and database files)
4:
